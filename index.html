            <p>Myself Md.Tur-Ibna Mostafiz. I have just successfully completed my B.Sc in CSE. I have much more interest
                on
                web development. That's why now am trying to start my career as a web developer. For that reason i have
                enrolled myself in a web development course named programming hero what is instructed by Jhankar
                Mahabub.
                It's such a great course to me. I am learning as well as enjoying this course very much. For this i want
                to
                be thankful to my friend & also my well wisher Fahim Shahriar. </p>
